## How to start a solution?

Because this is a client-set web application and REST API, we have to start BE and FE projects separately. In a future they have to be hosted seperately.

### To start BE application.

BE application starting project is **Application.csproj**

If you have an IDE (Visual Studio or any other) you could build Application.csproj project and run it. (This would run BE application)


### To start a FE application.

Open terminal

`cd .\Presentation\`

`npm start`
